CLI game similar to the board game "Das verrÃ¼ckte Labyrinth" by Ravensburger which is popular especially in Germany.

We will publish a blog series about our experience coding this game.

## Status: This is WIP, work in progress.

18 Mar 2019:

- working board, piece types with orientation and pushing pieces
- working players and moving them through labyrinth
- working card stacks and working them off when player lands on the respective pieces
- accepts user input via CLI - but fixed to 2 players with one move each rn

TODO:
- Unlimited moves and WIN game when card stack is empty => FULL GAME!
- board surrounding graphics: directions, slots
- display current piece-in-hand and card

## Run

After cloning this repository, just enter into terminal: `ruby app.rb`
